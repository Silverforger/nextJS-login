This is a next.JS project for a simple login page. This was made using nextJS and a json-server for a simple backend for keeping the accouts made through signing up.

To run this project, you can Git Bash or run a CMD inside the directory and enter the following in sequence:

**npm run server**

**npm run dev**

The first line will run the json-server, which is the db.json file that will be running on localhost:5000/. The actual website will be running on localhost:3000/

Credentials are kept in the json file, which can be accessed through the browser in localhost:5000/credentials.
